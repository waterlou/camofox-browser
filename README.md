## Why

AI agents need to browse the real web. Playwright gets blocked. Headless Chrome gets fingerprinted. Stealth plugins become the fingerprint.

Camoufox patches Firefox at the **C++ implementation level** - `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`, WebGL renderers, AudioContext, screen geometry, WebRTC - all spoofed before JavaScript ever sees them. No shims, no wrappers, no tells.

This project wraps that engine in a REST API built for agents: accessibility snapshots instead of bloated HTML, stable element refs for clicking, and search macros for common sites.

## Features

- **C++ Anti-Detection** - bypasses Google, Cloudflare, and most bot detection
- **Element Refs** - stable `e1`, `e2`, `e3` identifiers for reliable interaction
- **Token-Efficient** - accessibility snapshots are ~90% smaller than raw HTML
- **Runs on Anything** - lazy browser launch + idle shutdown keeps memory at ~40MB when idle. Designed to share a box with the rest of your stack — Raspberry Pi, $5 VPS, shared Railway infra.
- **Session Isolation** - separate cookies/storage per user
- **Cookie Import** - inject Netscape-format cookie files for authenticated browsing
- **Proxy + GeoIP** - route traffic through residential proxies with automatic locale/timezone
- **Structured Logging** - JSON log lines with request IDs for production observability
- **YouTube Transcripts** - extract captions from any YouTube video via yt-dlp, no API key needed
- **Search Macros** - `@google_search`, `@youtube_search`, `@amazon_search`, `@reddit_subreddit`, and 10 more
- **Snapshot Screenshots** - include a base64 PNG screenshot alongside the accessibility snapshot
- **Large Page Handling** - automatic snapshot truncation with offset-based pagination
- **Download Capture** - capture browser downloads and fetch them via API (optional inline base64)
- **DOM Image Extraction** - list `<img>` src/alt and optionally return inline data URLs
- **Deploy Anywhere** - Docker, Fly.io, Railway
- **VNC Interactive Login** - log into sites visually via noVNC, export storage state for agent reuse
- **OpenAPI Docs** - auto-generated spec at [`/openapi.json`](http://localhost:9377/openapi.json) and interactive docs at [`/docs`](http://localhost:9377/docs)
- **Structured Extract** - `POST /tabs/:tabId/extract` with a JSON Schema that maps properties to snapshot refs via `x-ref`
- **Session Tracing** - opt-in per-session Playwright trace capture (screenshots + DOM snapshots + network) with API endpoints to list, fetch, and delete trace zips
- **Crash Reporter** - automatic [anonymized crash/hang reporting](lib/reporter.js#L28-L290) via GitHub Issues. Identifies which sites cause failures and common failure patterns. Private domains are HMAC-hashed, paths/params stripped, tokens/IPs redacted. Opt-out with `CAMOFOX_CRASH_REPORT_ENABLED=false`.

## Optional Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) | YouTube transcript extraction (fast path) | `pip install yt-dlp` or `brew install yt-dlp` |

The Docker image includes yt-dlp. For local dev, install it for the `/youtube/transcript` endpoint. Without it, the endpoint falls back to a slower browser-based method.

## Quick Start

### OpenClaw Plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install @askjo/camofox-browser
```

**Tools:** `camofox_create_tab` · `camofox_snapshot` · `camofox_click` · `camofox_type` · `camofox_navigate` · `camofox_scroll` · `camofox_screenshot` · `camofox_close_tab` · `camofox_list_tabs` · `camofox_import_cookies`

### Standalone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jo-inc/camofox-browser
cd camofox-browser
npm install
npm start  # downloads Camoufox on first run (~300MB)
```

Default port is `9377`. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for all options.

### Docker

The included `Makefile` auto-detects your CPU architecture and pre-downloads Camoufox + yt-dlp binaries outside the Docker build, so rebuilds are fast (~30s vs ~3min).

```bash
# Build and start (auto-detects arch: aarch64 on M1/M2, x86_64 on Intel)
make up

# Stop and remove the container
make down

# Force a clean rebuild (e.g. after upgrading VERSION/RELEASE)
make reset

# Just download binaries (without building)
make fetch

# Override arch or version explicitly
make up ARCH=x86_64
make up VERSION=135.0.1 RELEASE=beta.24
```

> **⚠️ Do not run `docker build` directly.** The Dockerfile uses bind mounts to pull pre-downloaded binaries from `dist/`. Always use `make up` (or `make fetch` then `make build`) — it downloads the binaries first.

### Fly.io / Railway

`railway.toml` is included. For Fly.io or other remote CI, you'll need a Dockerfile that downloads binaries at build time instead of using bind mounts — see [jo-browser](https://github.com/jo-inc/jo-browser) for an example.

## Usage

### Cookie Import

Import cookies from your browser into Camoufox to skip interactive login on sites like LinkedIn, Amazon, etc.

#### Setup

**1. Generate a secret key:**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**2. Set the environment variable before starting OpenClaw:**

```bash
export CAMOFOX_API_KEY="your-generated-key"
openclaw start
```

The same key is used by both the plugin (to authenticate requests) and the server (to verify them). Both run from the same environment — set it once.

> **Why an env var?** The key is a secret. Plugin config in `openclaw.json` is stored in plaintext, so secrets don't belong there. Set `CAMOFOX_API_KEY` in your shell profile, systemd unit, Docker env, or Fly.io secrets.

> **Cookie import is disabled by default.** If `CAMOFOX_API_KEY` is not set, the server rejects all cookie requests with 403.

**3. Export cookies from your browser:**

Install a browser extension that exports Netscape-format cookie files (e.g., "cookies.txt" for Chrome/Firefox). Export the cookies for the site you want to authenticate.

**4. Place the cookie file:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.camofox/cookies
cp ~/Downloads/linkedin_cookies.txt ~/.camofox/cookies/linkedin.txt
```

The default directory is `~/.camofox/cookies/`. Override with `CAMOFOX_COOKIES_DIR`.

**5. Ask your agent to import them:**

> Import my LinkedIn cookies from linkedin.txt

The agent calls `camofox_import_cookies` → reads the file → POSTs to the server with the Bearer token → cookies are injected into the browser session. Subsequent `camofox_create_tab` calls to linkedin.com will be authenticated.

#### How it works

```
~/.camofox/cookies/linkedin.txt          (Netscape format, on disk)
        │
        ▼
camofox_import_cookies tool              (parses file, filters by domain)
        │
        ▼  POST /sessions/:userId/cookies
        │  Authorization: Bearer <CAMOFOX_API_KEY>
        │  Body: { cookies: [Playwright cookie objects] }
        ▼
camofox server                           (validates, sanitizes, injects)
        │
        ▼  context.addCookies(...)
        │
Camoufox browser session                 (authenticated browsing)
```

- `cookiesPath` is resolved relative to the cookies directory — path traversal outside it is blocked
- Max 500 cookies per request, 5MB file size limit
- Cookie objects are sanitized to an allowlist of Playwright fields

### Session Persistence

By default, camofox persists each user's cookies and localStorage to `~/.camofox/profiles/`. Sessions survive browser restarts — log in once (via cookies or VNC), and subsequent sessions restore the authenticated state automatically.

```
~/.camofox/
├── cookies/          # Bootstrap cookie files (Netscape format)
└── profiles/         # Persisted session state (auto-managed)
    └── <hashed-userId>/
        └── storage_state.json
```

Override the directory with `CAMOFOX_PROFILE_DIR` or set `"profileDir"` in the persistence plugin config. To disable persistence, set `"persistence": { "enabled": false }` in `camofox.config.json`.

### Session Tracing

Capture a Playwright trace of every action in a session: page screenshots, DOM snapshots, network requests, and console output. Output is a single `.zip` file you can open in Playwright's built-in Trace Viewer.

Opt-in per session by passing `trace: true` when opening the first tab:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/tabs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId":"agent1","sessionKey":"task1","url":"https://example.com","trace":true}'
```

The trace is written when the session closes. Close the session to flush it, then list, fetch, and view:

```bash
# Close the session to flush the trace
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9377/sessions/agent1

# List trace files
curl http://localhost:9377/sessions/agent1/traces
# {"traces":[{"filename":"trace-2026-04-18T04-05-00-...zip","sizeBytes":42810,"createdAt":...}]}

# Download (Content-Type: application/zip)
curl http://localhost:9377/sessions/agent1/traces/trace-2026-04-18T04-05-00-abc.zip > session.zip

# View it in Playwright's Trace Viewer
npx playwright show-trace session.zip

# Delete
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9377/sessions/agent1/traces/trace-2026-04-18T04-05-00-abc.zip
```

Why traces instead of video: Camoufox is Firefox-based, and Playwright's `recordVideo` is Chromium-only. Traces work on Firefox and give you more than video (network + DOM + console + screenshots).

Tracing cannot be toggled on an existing session. `DELETE /sessions/:userId` first if you need to change the flag.

Storage defaults to `~/.camofox/traces/<hashed-userId>/` and is swept on server startup:

- `CAMOFOX_TRACES_DIR` - base directory (default: `~/.camofox/traces`)
- `CAMOFOX_TRACES_MAX_BYTES` - max size per trace, removed at next startup if exceeded (default: 50MB)
- `CAMOFOX_TRACES_TTL_HOURS` - traces older than this are removed at next startup (default: 24)

#### Standalone server usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/sessions/agent1/cookies \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CAMOFOX_API_KEY' \
  -d '{"cookies":[{"name":"foo","value":"bar","domain":"example.com","path":"/","expires":-1,"httpOnly":false,"secure":false}]}'
```

#### Docker / Fly.io

```bash
docker run -p 9377:9377 \
  -e CAMOFOX_API_KEY="your-generated-key" \
  -v ~/.camofox/cookies:/home/node/.camofox/cookies:ro \
  camofox-browser
```

For Fly.io:
```bash
fly secrets set CAMOFOX_API_KEY="your-generated-key"
```

### Proxy + GeoIP

Route all browser traffic through a proxy with automatic locale, timezone, and geolocation derived from the proxy's IP address via Camoufox's built-in GeoIP.

**Simple proxy (single endpoint):**

```bash
export PROXY_HOST=166.88.179.132
export PROXY_PORT=46040
export PROXY_USERNAME=myuser
export PROXY_PASSWORD=mypass
npm start
```

**Backconnect proxy (rotating sticky sessions):**

For providers like Decodo, Bright Data, or Oxylabs that offer a single gateway endpoint with session-based sticky IPs:

```bash
export PROXY_STRATEGY=backconnect
export PROXY_BACKCONNECT_HOST=gate.provider.com
export PROXY_BACKCONNECT_PORT=7000
export PROXY_USERNAME=myuser
export PROXY_PASSWORD=mypass
npm start
```

Each browser context gets a unique sticky session, so different users get different IP addresses. Sessions rotate automatically on proxy errors or Google blocks.

Or in Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 9377:9377 \
  -e PROXY_HOST=166.88.179.132 \
  -e PROXY_PORT=46040 \
  -e PROXY_USERNAME=myuser \
  -e PROXY_PASSWORD=mypass \
  camofox-browser
```

When a proxy is configured:
- All traffic routes through the proxy
- Camoufox's GeoIP automatically sets `locale`, `timezone`, and `geolocation` to match the proxy's exit IP
- Browser fingerprint (language, timezone, coordinates) is consistent with the proxy location
- Without a proxy, defaults to `en-US`, `America/Los_Angeles`, San Francisco coordinates

### Crash Reporter

Browser automation fails in ways that are hard to predict — Cloudflare challenges, site redesigns breaking selectors, redirect loops, dialog storms, renderer crashes. The scope is wide and the failure modes are diverse. Without telemetry, the only signal is "it didn't work."

The crash reporter gives us structured data on *which sites fail*, *how they fail*, and *how often*, so we can prioritize fixes for the patterns that actually affect users. It files GitHub Issues automatically when:

- **Uncaught exceptions** crash the process
- **Event loop stalls** exceed 5 seconds (watchdog detection)
- **Frustration patterns** — 3+ consecutive failures (timeout, dead context, navigation abort) on the same tab

Each report includes the failure type, stack trace, tab health counters (HTTP status histogram, console errors, request failures, redirect depth), and the target URL — all anonymized.

#### Privacy

All reported data goes through paranoid anonymization ([`lib/reporter.js` L28–290](lib/reporter.js#L28-L290)) before leaving the process:

- **URLs** — well-known public domains (Google, Amazon, Reddit, Cloudflare, etc.) are shown verbatim so we can identify which sites cause problems. Private/unknown domains are replaced with a stable HMAC hash (`site-a1b2c3d4`) — same hash across reports for correlation, but not reversible to the original domain. Path segments become `•/•/•` (depth only). Query params become `?[3]` (count only). No keys, values, or path content is ever included.
- **File paths** → stripped to filename only (`<path>/server.js`)
- **Tokens, secrets, API keys** → `<token>`
- **IPs, emails, env vars** → redacted
- **Docker/Fly machine IDs** → `<id>`
- **Tab health** — pure counters (crash count, error count, status code histogram). No page content, no URLs, no user data.

Duplicate issues are detected by stack signature and get a `+1` comment instead of a new issue.

Uses a dedicated GitHub App ([Camofox Crash/Stuck Reporter](https://github.com/apps/camofox-crash-stuck-reporter)) with issues-only permissions — no PAT or configuration required.

```bash
# Disable crash reporting
export CAMOFOX_CRASH_REPORT_ENABLED=false

# Report to a different repo (default: jo-inc/camofox-browser)
export CAMOFOX_CRASH_REPORT_REPO=your-org/your-repo

# Adjust rate limit (default: 10 per hour)
export CAMOFOX_CRASH_REPORT_RATE_LIMIT=5
```

#### Reporting to your own repo

By default, reports go to `jo-inc/camofox-browser`. To file issues in your own repo instead, create a GitHub App:

1. Go to **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**
2. Set permissions: **Repository → Issues → Read & Write**. Uncheck **Webhook → Active**.
3. Click **Generate a private key** — downloads a `.pem` file
4. Install the app on your target repo (Install App → select repo)
5. Note your **App ID** (number on the app's settings page) and **Installation ID** (from the URL after installing: `github.com/settings/installations/{id}`)
6. Base64-encode the private key and split it into two halves:
   ```bash
   base64 < your-app.pem | tr -d '\n' | fold -w $(($(base64 < your-app.pem | tr -d '\n' | wc -c) / 2)) | head -2
   ```
7. Replace `_GH_APP_ID`, `_GH_INSTALL_ID`, `_K_A`, and `_K_B` in `lib/reporter.js` with your values
8. Set `CAMOFOX_CRASH_REPORT_REPO=your-org/your-repo`

### Structured Logging

All log output is JSON (one object per line) for easy parsing by log aggregators:

```json
{"ts":"2026-02-11T23:45:01.234Z","level":"info","msg":"req","reqId":"a1b2c3d4","method":"POST","path":"/tabs","userId":"agent1"}
{"ts":"2026-02-11T23:45:01.567Z","level":"info","msg":"res","reqId":"a1b2c3d4","status":200,"ms":333}
```

Health check requests (`/health`) are excluded from request logging to reduce noise.

### Basic Browsing

```bash
# Create a tab
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/tabs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId": "agent1", "sessionKey": "task1", "url": "https://example.com"}'

# Get accessibility snapshot with element refs
curl "http://localhost:9377/tabs/TAB_ID/snapshot?userId=agent1"
# → { "snapshot": "[button e1] Submit  [link e2] Learn more", ... }

# Click by ref
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/tabs/TAB_ID/click \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId": "agent1", "ref": "e1"}'

# Type into an element
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/tabs/TAB_ID/type \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId": "agent1", "ref": "e2", "text": "hello", "pressEnter": true}'

# Navigate with a search macro
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/tabs/TAB_ID/navigate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId": "agent1", "macro": "@google_search", "query": "best coffee beans"}'
```

### YouTube Transcript

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/youtube/transcript` | Extract captions from a YouTube video |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9377/youtube/transcript \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ", "languages": ["en"]}'
# → { "status": "ok", "transcript": "[00:18] ♪ We're no strangers to love ♪\n...", "video_title": "...", "total_words": 548 }
```

Uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) when available (fast, no browser needed). Falls back to a browser-based intercept method if yt-dlp is not installed — this is slower and less reliable due to YouTube ad pre-rolls.

## Architecture

```
Browser Instance (Camoufox)
└── User Session (BrowserContext) - isolated cookies/storage
    ├── Tab Group (sessionKey: "conv1")
    │   ├── Tab (google.com)
    │   └── Tab (github.com)
    └── Tab Group (sessionKey: "conv2")
        └── Tab (amazon.com)
```

Sessions auto-expire after 30 minutes of inactivity. The browser itself shuts down after 5 minutes with no active sessions, and relaunches on the next request.

When a session's tab limit is reached, the oldest/least-used tab is automatically recycled instead of returning an error — so long-running agent sessions don't hit dead ends.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # all tests
npm run test:e2e      # e2e tests only
npm run test:live     # live site tests (Google, macros)
npm run test:debug    # with server output
```

## npm

```bash
npm install @askjo/camofox-browser
